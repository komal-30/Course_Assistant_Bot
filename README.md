course details.It also has small talk features in case the user has some trivial questions for the bot.It also supports commonly asked Faqs.

Abstract
Recently, education is becoming more accessible to a wider group of people
through technology. The concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning have
provided substantial assistance in the field of education.
The chatbot's functioning depends on natural language processing that helps
users to submit their queries. The chatbot answers all the queries related to the
courses and other details and sends appropriate responses to help the users. This
conversational system is built using Google Dialog Flow which is a natural language
understanding platform used to design and integrate a conversational user interface
into web applications.

Solution
The concept of natural language processing of Google Dialog Flow is used to create
interactive chatbots. The intents and entities in Dialog Flow help to determine the
intention of the user and provide a valid response.It can prove to be a great assistant to
handle online traffic related to course enquiries in and across large educational
institutes.
